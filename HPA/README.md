# Kubernetes HPA Controller (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) on Minikube Cluster

## In this demo, we will see how to deploy HPA controller. HPA will automatically scale the number of pods based on CPU utilization.


### Pre-requisites to implement this project:

- Create 1 virtual machine on AWS with 2 CPU, 4GB of RAM (t2.medium)
- Setup minikube on it Minikube setup.
- Ensure you have the Metrics Server installed in your Minikube cluster to enable HPA. If not already installed, you can install it using:
```bash
minikube addons enable metrics-server
```
- Check minikube cluster status and nodes :
```bash
minikube status
kubectl get nodes
```
#
## What we are going to implement:
In this demo, we will create an deployment & service files for Apache and with the help of HPA, we will automatically scale the number of pods based on CPU utilization.
#
### Steps to implement HPA:

- Update the Deployments:

  - We'll modify the existing Apache deployment YAML files to include resource requests and limits. This is required for HPA to monitor CPU usage.
```bash
#apache-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: apache-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: apache
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: apache
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: apache
        image: httpd:2.4
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
          limits:
            cpu: 200m
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: apache-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: apache
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```
#
- Apply the updated deployments:
```bash
kubectl apply -f apache-deployment.yaml
```
#
- Create HPA Resources
  - We will create HPA resources for both Apache and NGINX deployments. The HPA will scale the number of pods based on CPU utilization.
```bash
#apache-hpa.yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: apache-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: apache-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 20
```
#
- Apply the HPA resources:
```bash
kubectl apply -f apache-hpa.yaml
```
#
- port forward to access the Apache service on browser.
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/apache-service 8081:80 --address 0.0.0.0 &
```
#
- Verify HPA
  - You can check the status of the HPA using the following command:
```bash
kubectl get hpa
```
> This will show you the current state of the HPA, including the current and desired number of replicas.

#
### Stress Testing
#
- To see HPA in action, you can perform a stress test on your deployments. Here is an example of how to generate load on the Apache deployment using 'BusyBox':
```bash
kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --image=busybox /bin/sh
```
#
- Inside the container, use 'wget' to generate load:
```bash
while true; do wget -q -O- http://apache-service.default.svc.cluster.local; done
```

This will generate continuous load on the Apache service, causing the HPA to scale up the number of pods.

#
- Now to check if HPA worked or not, open a same new terminal and run the following command
```bash
kubectl get hpa -w
```

> Note: Wait for few minutes to get the status reflected.
